Use eigen-strain and eigen-stress (principal component) works
for elasticity.
This is verified. 
However, we should pay attention to the ordering of the 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
Keep the same ordering. 

How to abstract this to math representation?:
The stiffness should be isotropic tensor. Otherwise, we cannot 
compute the principal components only.
